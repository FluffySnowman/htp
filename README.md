# HTP 

Simple and efficient http client written in python.

Similar to `curl` or `httpie` but they didn't have features I wanted by default
so I made my own toned-down version for common use cases.

> Note: This tool is built for my use case and preferences so  you probably dont
> wanna bother using it. I've been using this script (now updated with some more
> features) for a long time and its annoying having to use my dotfiles for it
> which is why I've made this repo public. Don't expect me to accept pull
> requests since this is just for me.

## Documentation

There are 2 places to find the documentation. One is here in the readme and the
other is by passing the `doc` argument to the script like so:

```shell 
./htp.py doc
```

Which will pretty much display the same content as this readme.

Why are the docs inside the script itself ? *  * everywhere at the end of time
starts playing...*  *
