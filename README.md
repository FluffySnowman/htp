# HTP 

Simple and efficient http client written in python.

Similar to `curl` or `httpie` but they didn't have features I wanted by default
so I made my own toned-down version for common use cases.

There are 2 places to find the documentation. One is here in the readme and the
other is by passing the `doc` argument to the script like so:

```shell 
./htp.py doc
```

Which will pretty much display the same content as the doc section on this
readme.

Why are the docs inside the script itself ? *everywhere at the end of time
starts playing... ðŸ« *

# Docs 

Below are the docs for the `htp` script (also embedded into the script itself)

## Brief

This script is meant to make it easier to interact with APIs that have dynamic
data (i.e. authentication tokens) that need to be passed with each request.

Most of the time, you will need to set the base URL for the API after which you
can simply send requests to each endpoint by using the path
`/api/v1/my-endpoint` rather than having to do the whole
`http://localhost:8000/api/v1/my-endpoint` every time and including headers and
writing json data to send in the request body and then using `jq`'s scuffed
syntax to filter through it.

This script also allows you to log in to the API to obtain an authentication
token which is then sent with all requests.

## Cheatsheet

- Set Base URL

`./htp.py set-base-url --base-url http://localhost:8000/api/v1`

- Log In 

`./htp.py login --username admin --password secret`

- Log In Direct URL 

`./htp.py login --url http://localhost:8888/login --username myuser --password mypass`

- Send GET Request 

`./htp.py req GET /users`

- Send GET Request to anywhere (like curl) 

`./htp.py req GET --url http://localhost:8888/get-something`

- Send POST Request & Extract JSON Fields 

`./htp.py req POST /jsonshit --fields username,user_id`

- Send POST Request w/ JSON data

`./htp.py req POST --url http://localhost:8888/login --data username=shit password=notshit`

The docs below are incomplete and will not be completed since I'm the only guy who's
gonna use this.

# Usage 

### Setting the Base URL

Set the base URL for the API:

```sh
./htp.py set-base-url --base-url http://localhost:8000/api/v1
```

This will create a `.htp/` directory in the current directory that you are in.
Remember to add this directory to your `.gitignore` or `.dockerignore` etc.

The base url will be save to the `.htp/base_url.env` file.

### Logging In

Log in to the API to obtain an authentication token:

```sh
./htp.py login --username your_username --password your_password
```

By default this will send a POST request to `${base_url}/login` and will save
the contents of the `Authorization` header to `.htp/auth_token.env` file.

You can also manually specify the endpoint to send the login request to:

```sh
./htp.py login --url http://localhost:8888/login --username myuser --password mypass
```

Which will also save the contents of the `Authorization` header to
`.htp/auth_token.env` file (even if empty).

### Sending Requests

Each request will automatically include the authentication token in the headers.
If you wish to manually specify a url to send a request to then the `--url` flag
can be used just like how you would with curl, httpie etc.

Send a GET request to an endpoint:

```sh
# Send a GET request to ${base_url}/endpoint 
./htp.py req GET /endpoint
# Send a GET request to http://localhost:8000/api/v1/endpoint 
./htp.py req GET ...
```

**THIS DOCUMENTATION IS INCOMPLETE AND WILL PROBABLY NOT BE UPDATED** since I
can't be arsed writing documentation for something only I will use. Hence
there's a cheatsheet.
